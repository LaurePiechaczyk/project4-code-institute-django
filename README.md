<h1 align="center"> Project 4 for Code Institute formation | DieDerDas | HTML - CSS - JS - DJANGO</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://project4-interim-vs-10nov21.herokuapp.com/)

DieDerDas is a website to learn the gender of German nouns with colors. It is an original Idea I had 2 years ago when I started to learn German and 'i had made a first website prototype in 2020 (not online anymore). 

In this version, users can login and interact with the database to enter there set of Nouns or they can use the default nouns.
This project is built as part of a project for the [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) (training to become a web developer).

## Background to understand the purpose of the game
In German, nouns are associated with one of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter.

It leads to the question: 
How do we learn which gender is associated with a noun?

## Aim of the project
Create a website to help the user learning German Nouns by associated colors to the nouns.

# Target audience
Learners of German, especially those who want to improve their knowledge of German Nouns genders.
