<h1 align="center"> Project 4 for Code Institute formation | DieDerDas | HTML - CSS - JS - DJANGO</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://project4-german-in-color.herokuapp.com/)

DieDerDas is a website to learn the gender of German nouns with colors. It's an original idea I had 2 years ago when I started learning German and I made a first prototype of the site in 2020 (which is no longer online). 

In this version, users can log in and interact with the database to enter their own set of nouns or they can use the default nouns.


This project is built as part of a project for the [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) (training to become a web developer).

# Background to understand the purpose of the website
In German, nouns are associated with one of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter.

It leads to the question: 
How do we learn which gender is associated with a noun?

## Aim of the project
Create a website to help the user learn German nouns by associating colors to the nouns.

## Target audience
Learners of German, especially those who want to improve their knowledge of German Nouns genders.

# Data structure


# Features 

- ### Hero Section
An image with colors was used for the hero section to illustrate the theme of the site which aims to help learn German with colors.
An animation was made on the text, where "German with Colors" becomes "Learn with colors" when the mouse passes over it. The objective is to stimulate and interest the user.

Buttons to access sub-sections of the site are placed in the hero so that the user can quickly go to the desired place on the site.

<h3 align="center"><img src="static/images/readme/Hero-section.png"></h3>

- ### How it works Section
The section explains the concept of the website without too much text to not bore the user. 

An example with animation has been created so that the user can understand the concept even without reading the text. 

The user can also customize the colors associated with each gender.
<h3 align="center"><img src="static/images/readme/How-it-works.png"></h3>

- ### Start learning Section
The user can click on the buttons to start learning. If the user is registered, he/she has the possibility to use own nouns as well as the default nouns.
<h3 align="center"><img src="static/images/readme/start-learning.png"></h3>


- ### Register, Login, Logout Section
Users can register, log in and log out to access their own dashboard.
<h3 align="center"><img src="static/images/readme/signin.png"></h3>


- ### Dashboard Section
In the dashboard, the user can have a list of tasks, edit, toogle and delete the items.
The user can also enter, edit and delete nouns.

- ### Add edit delete
<h3 align="center"><img src="static/images/readme/add-nouns.png"></h3>

- ### Footer
The footer was kept simple, with a sentence and an email address for contact. Since no social media was created for this project, no links were added. The email address is real and I would receive inquiries.

## Responsiveness
The website is designed to be suitable for all devices. For example, the responsive navigation bar turns into a burger button for phone screens.

## Futur
The user can add its own categories, 
level of difficulties with the Nouns
When a noun is clicked, the card can turn and a sentence with the noun is written to help learning nouns in a context.

# Deployment
## GitHub Pages
The project was stored in GitHub and deployed in Heroku. Heroku Postgres was used for the database. Cloudinary to store the pictures.


## Making a Local Clone
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- Click the Code drop down menu.
- Either download the ZIP file, unpackage locally and open with IDE OR to clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
- Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied.
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
- Create a file called env.py to hold your app's environment variables, which should contain the following:
```console
import os

os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "app database"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "app secret key"
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary URL"

```
- Make sure the following are listed in your .gitignore file to prevent any environment variables being pushed publicly:
`env.py`


### Installing required softwares
In the terminal enter 

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Applying database migrations
In the terminal enter 
```
python manage.py migrate
```
### Creating a new superuser
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
### Creating a Default User
To be done just after the superuser creation so the id of the Default user will be 2 (important to use the default nouns).
Can be done in Admin.

### Entering Genders
Still in Admin, Add 3 genders. It is important to keep the following order:
1- Neutral
2- Masculin
3- Feminin

### Load categories and noun data from json file (found in home --> fixtures)
- load first categories by entering in the terminal:
`python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
- Then load the nouns by entering in the terminal:
`python3 manage.py loaddata nouns`

### The app can now be run locally using
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Heroku Deployment
- Register or login [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)
- Choose a unique name for the app and the location nearest to you.
- Under **Resources** search for and add **Heroku Postgres** to your app
- In your local environement in the env.py file, enter the database URL (to find the URL, in HEROKU go to settings --> click "Reveal Config VARS")
- In Heroku, add a SECRET_KEY var (must be the same as the one in your env.py file)
- Add the hostname of your Heroku app to settings.py
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
- In Heroku, select the **Deploy** tab and under **Deployment method** choose GitHub
- In **Connect to GitHub** enter your GitHub repository details and once found, click **Connect**
- under **Manual deploy** choose **Deploy Branch**

- The steps from the previous section have to be repeated to load data in the new database (can be done in the local environment):
  - Applying database migrations
  - Creating a new superuser
  - Creating an Default User
  - Entering Genders
  - Load categories and noun data from json file
